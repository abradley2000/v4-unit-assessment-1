            <h3>About HTML5</h3>
            <img class="htmlimg" src="https://rapidapi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/logo-2582748_640.png">
            <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content
                on the World Wide Web. It is this fith and latest major version of 
                HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) reccomendation. The 
                current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is 
                maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple,
                Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application 
                Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
            <p>HTML 5 was first released in public-facing from on 22 January 2008,
                with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
                Itss goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
                multimedia and other nwe features; to keep the language both easily
                readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
                devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's
                rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software, HTML5
                is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level
                2 HTML.</p>

            <h3>About CSS3</h3>
            <img class="cssimg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/CSS.3.svg/730px-CSS.3.svg.png">
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for<br>
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
                like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the seperation of presentation and content,
                including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
                content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the 
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
                to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                file, and reduce complexity and repitition in the structural content.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasable to 
                present the same markup page in different styles for different
                rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                speech-based browseer or screen reader), and on the Braille-based
                tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
                content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes 
                from the specified priority scheme to determine which styles rule 
                applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This 
                cascading priority schme is predictable.</p>
            <p>The CSSS specifications are maintained by the WWorld Wide Web
                Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is 
                registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C
                operates a free CSS validation service for CSSS documents. In
                addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of 
                CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
